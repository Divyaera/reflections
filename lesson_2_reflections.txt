What happens when you intitialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initializing any normal repository into a git-repository makes it to obtain
    all the properties of a git repostory like commit, file tracking, diff, logs 
    etc. i.e. it transforms any normal repository into a git one acquiring all of 
    it's commands, tools and behaviour.

    It is achieved through this command:
        git init

    I strongly need it because, any normal repository does not have all the features
    that a git repository has like version control, file tracking etc. Also, for 
    becoming a good programmer and to code freely without any loss of information, I
    need it to be a git repository
